# What is REST API and why REST API?
It stands for **Representational Stae Transfer Application Programming Interface**.

Say I have a website and I want to get information from the server or send data to it.

REST API is a way for your website or app to talk to that server and ask for the data it needs or send data to be saved on the server. It's like a language that allows different systems to communicate and exchange information.

**Key Characteristics of REST API:**
1. Stateless: Each API request from Client to server contains all the information required for understanding and processing that request, hence it does not have depend on server to store information and hence scaling becomes easy.
2. It can be used with a wide variety of programming langauges, so it does not matter that the website from which we are willing is written in which programming langauge, REST API can definately be used.
3. Supports caching: If there is some data that is not changing frequently, it will be cached in the user's device.
4. W can communicate with REST API using a wide variety of data formats like JSON, XML, etc. JSON being the most popular and widely used.
