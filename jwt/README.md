# Benefits of JWT:
1. Stateless authentication: Here servers are not bearing the load of storing the session information. All the details are encapsulated within the token itself. The tokens have three parts- Header, Payload and the verify signature.
2. Security: Since it is signed by a secret or public key, it provides integrity to the token and ensures that no one can tamper with it.
3. Decentralisation: Since the token itself contains all the necessary information, it can be passed on to different microservices or API, without compelling them to query a centralised authentication system again and again.
4. SSO: Can also be used as Single sign on service - accessing multiple applications using a single sign on.
5. Expiration and revocation/blacklisting.
6. JWTs are compact.
   
Finally we can say that, JWTs provide a secure, efficient, and flexible way to implement authentication and authorization mechanisms in modern web applications and APIs. But, it is essential to use JWTs properly, including handling token expiration and revocation, keeping the secret key secure, and carefully considering the token payload to avoid including sensitive information.
